# AtlasSuite-SWAIN


## SWAIN is designed to help CyberDefenders automate features included in Defender 365 (O365)
The first section of SWAIN is the CSCT: Content Search Creation Tool.
The second section of SWAIN is the PurgeTool.

The Defender 365 admin portal is *very* clunky, and takes way too long. 
This combined with Security Teams around the world having problems purging email is what birthed SWAIN.
No matter what your budget, you should be able to defend against the most previlent threat that Blue Teams face: Spam and Phishing.

Code is open to use and download. an .exe of SWAIN can be found at  https://www.thesecurityatlas.com/

Some dependencies are required for this tool to work in your environment (If we have forgotten any dependencies please raise an issue so the documentation can be altered)

Full list of dependencies can be found in BeforeFirstRun.txt

Any feedback is welcomed. 

**GUI is coming soon**
